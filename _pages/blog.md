# The Vulnerabilities of Multi-Drone System: A Cybersecurity Perspective

Multi-drone shows, or drone swarms, are a popular form of entertainment that involves coordinating the movements of multiple drones to create a visually striking display. These shows are often used for events such as concerts, sporting events, and advertising campaigns, and they have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their ability to create visually stunning displays that can be difficult to achieve with traditional lighting and pyrotechnics.

One approach to building a drone detection system is to use machine learning techniques. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. By training a machine learning model on a large dataset of drone images and videos, it is possible to build a drone detection system that can accurately identify and classify different types of drones.
